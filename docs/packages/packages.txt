package = project = workspace
Collection of common source files
Package could contain many *.go files

Usually single app will have single package

each source code need to start with package statement

There are 2 types of packages:
- Executable - Generate a file that can run
- Reusable - Code used as "helpers", placing reusable logic (code dependencies, libs)

In go - if the package name is 'main' then package is executable!
Otherwise - Reusable


Executable package - must have func called 'main'
