Array - fixed length list of things

Type must be the same!

Slice - An array that can grow or shrink (like java list/set)

Initialization:
cards := [] string {"Ace of Diamonds" , newCard()}


Append:
//append appends elements to the end of a slice and return new slice
	cards = append(cards, "six of spades")

iterate over closed set (array/slice)
//for	_, card := range cards {
	for i, card := range cards {
		fmt.Println(i, card)
	}
